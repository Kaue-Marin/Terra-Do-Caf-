# Change Log

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 98f1bb7e: Ensure all lit imports are imported from @lion/core. Remove devDependencies in all subpackages and move to root package.json. Add demo dependencies as real dependencies for users that extend our docs/demos.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 39d5e767: Changed on how to handle multiple instances of the singleton manager

  - save the map instance on the window object so multiple singleton manager versions can share the data.
  - ignore subsequential set calls if the key is already set (did throw before)

## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 3c61fd29: Add types to form-core, for everything except form-group, choice-group and validate. Also added index.d.ts (re-)export files to git so that interdependent packages can use their types locally.
- 09d96759: Added basic JSDocs types to SingletonManager, in order for localize to be able to be typed correctly.

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
