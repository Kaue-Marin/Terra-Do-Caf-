- [lion-switch](https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/blob/master/packages/form-core/docs/switch)

## Features

- Get or set the value of the choice - `choiceValue()`
- Get or set the modelValue (value and checked-state) of the choice - `.modelValue`
- Pre-select an option by setting the `checked` boolean attribute
